# ixigo_makeover

## Overview

This project is a **product makeover and strategy case study** focused on IXIGO — India’s leading travel booking platform.  
The goal was to **analyze user pain points, identify business opportunities, and propose actionable product improvements** that enhance user engagement, retention, and monetization.

---

## Objectives

- Understand IXIGO’s user journey and identify friction points.  
- Redesign the **core experience** to align with user motivations and market trends.  
- Propose **data-driven product interventions** and **feature enhancements**.  
- Illustrate measurable impact through **user metrics and business outcomes**.

---

## Research & Insights

- Conducted **heuristic evaluation** and **competitor benchmarking** (MakeMyTrip, Cleartrip, IRCTC).  
- Analyzed **user reviews**, **app store feedback**, and **social media sentiment**.  
- Mapped **top travel planning pain points** — price unpredictability, fragmented experience, and cluttered UI.  
- Defined **three core user personas**:  
  1. *Budget Explorer* — price-sensitive and time-flexible traveler.  
  2. *Frequent Flier* — values convenience and reliability.  
  3. *Planner Pro* — seeks multi-mode coordination and booking efficiency.

---

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Smart Trip Bundles** — dynamically recommend combined train-flight-hotel itineraries optimized by price and time.  
2. **IXIGO Wallet Upgrade** — introduce rewards gamification for repeat users.  
3. **Price Stability Badge** — visually indicate routes with low fare volatility.  
4. **Revamped Onboarding Flow** — tailor early app experience based on travel intent (business, leisure, etc.).
